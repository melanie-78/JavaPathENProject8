# TourGuide

## Context

At TripMaster, the TourGuide app allows users to see nearby tourist attractions and get discounts on hotel stays and tickets to different shows. 
It has grown rapidly from 1000 to 30000 or even 100000. The consequences are slow operation, poor performance and many bugs.
The objective is to correct and complete the code so as to improve the operation of TourGuide.
